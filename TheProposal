The Problems we heard ...
“I’m at the very beginning or early stages of the startup process and need guidance and support, please and thank you.”
“I’m searching for a like-minded community & even teammates to build a for-purpose business with ” :)
“Trying to find purpose-aligned work as a freelancer/free-agent, without the ‘outsider’ treatment” :(
“Corporate does not work for me, but that’s all the opportunities I’m getting!”
“I want to support, join or consult a learning, growth-oriented organization.”
“I want to start or join something, however time, financial risk (and/or family commitments) are a concern.”
The Solutions we’re proposing... 

A 6-week funded immersion to create +3x for-Purpose Enterprises. Within the following 10 dynamics...

Within a network of talented people/entrepreneurs all building for-Purpose Enterprises.
Where each member of the network invests in the network first, and then in each business second as they see fit with their time + talents. 
With a clear differentiation between each member's personal purpose and the purpose of each business so no member can use a business for personal greed.
Maintain each business through a distributed management and control system so switching costs between businesses is low. 
Each business uses Purpose as its North Star. 
Care and concern between members of the network is more important than any one of the businesses, no matter how valuable one or more businesses become. 
Incentivize and create financial instruments for high velocity exchange of assets and resources between the businesses. 
Embed deliberately developmental learning practice within each business and through the entire network so people can grow to their potential through their work. 
Make sure each business builds its own unique culture independent but connected to the network. 
Legally ground these solutions in the bylaws of each business. 

The Investment we’re inviting you to make: Each Member must Invest Time, Talent and Cash. 

Each member invests 20% of their time for 5 weeks. 
Each member invests $1000 of cash in the network.
Each members decides how they will distribute the $1000 of cash by the end of the immersion.
Each
 member receives equity in at least one business for the time and cash they invest.

The Return on Investment we’re looking to provide to you: Each Member will Receive Dynamic Equity for their Cash, Time, and Talent evaluated at the time of the Equity Split Date for the business(s) they hold dynamic equity within. 

Dynamic Equity is financial instrument used to compensate early stage entrepreneurs and contributors before a business has become profitable. 

The Equity Split Date is when the dynamic equity becomes fixed equity which is triggered based upon an external valuation, an exit or sale of the business or because the business has de-risks it major assumptions.
